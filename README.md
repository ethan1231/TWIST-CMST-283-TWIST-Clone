# TWIST Web Project

This Github repository will contain all of the files necessary to build/run the TWIST website including both the database and the user interface.

If you would like to test the website as you code you will need to install the dependencies which is pretty simple.

Click on 'Terminal' tab in VS Code and click 'New Terminal'
In the terminal window/pane type 'npm install'

Now whenever you want to test out the project, simply type 'nodemon' into the terminal window. You can view the website by putting 'localhost:3000' into your web browsers address bar. To quit nodemon simply press 'CTRL + C while' in the terminal.
