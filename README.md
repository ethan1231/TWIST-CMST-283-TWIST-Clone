# TWIST Web Project

This Github repository will contain all of the files necessary to build/run the TWIST website including both the database and the user interface.

**DO NOT DIRECTLY COMMIT TO MAIN**  
This can cause problems with code that has been verified to work. Instead, you can create a branch off of the main to add or test new code. Once done, you can create a pull request and pull it back into the main branch.

## Running the Project Locally

I would highly recommend downloading or cloning the files to your computer to work on with the code editor Visual Studio Code(VS Code).  

Here is what you will need to do:

- Install node.js
- Install git (not GitHub)
- Install Visual Studio Code (not Visual Studio)
- Download files from GitHub or sign into GitHub using VS Code to clone the files

After you have these downloaded and installed, you will need to open up VS Code and make sure that you have the project folder open and that it detects that you are working on a GitHub project (bottom bar will turn from purple to blue and you will see a branch icon).  
  
If you would like to test the website as you code you will need to install the dependencies which is pretty simple.

1. Click on 'Terminal' tab in VS Code and click 'New Terminal'
2. In the terminal window/pane type 'npm install'

Now whenever you want to test out the project, simply type 'nodemon' into the terminal window. You can view the website by putting 'localhost:3000' into your web browsers address bar. To quit nodemon simply press 'CTRL + C while' in the terminal.

This README file will be replaced with an overview of the project when we submit the final build.
